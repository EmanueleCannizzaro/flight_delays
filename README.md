# Bokeh-Python-Visualization

A Bokeh project developed for learning and teaching Bokeh interactive plotting! 

See my [medium blog posts](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-visualization-with-bokeh-in-python-part-one-getting-started-a11655a467d4) about making bokeh apps. 

Requirements:
* Python 3.6 (may work on other versions but has not been tested)
* bokeh 0.12.16 (bokeh is a work in progress so subsequents update may break functionality. I will try to update as I can.)

The main application is located in the `bokeh_app` folder. To run the application,
open a command prompt, change to the directory containing `bokeh_app` and run
`bokeh serve --show bokeh_app/`. This runs a bokeh server locally
and will automatically open the interactive dashboard in your browser at localhost:5006. 

Any comments, suggestions, improvements are greatly appreciated!
